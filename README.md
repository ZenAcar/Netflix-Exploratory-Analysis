Our project is to explore Netflix viewing habits over the past 10 years. We'll examine the trends of tv shows vs movies, user demographics, genre preferences, netflix originals vs all movies, how threat of coronavirus has affected people viewing netflix over going to movie theater, and related questions as the data admits.    

Possible source for such data: 
* https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows
